# pk/render

`PkPainter` is a Qt-free command producer. Every effective state mutation and draw
submits one typed `PkPaintCommand` to the mandatory `PkPainterBackend`. `submit()` is
synchronous: its `const PkPaintCommand &` refers to a temporary that is valid only for
the duration of the call. A backend that defers or queues work must copy the command.
Command payloads are values (including COW path/image values), so copied commands
remain valid after the caller destroys or mutates the source values. `save` and
`restore` track the complete local pen/brush/transform/render-hint state; restoring an
empty stack does not submit an invalid restore command.

The measured surface is limited to Crop, Knife, Karbon Calligraphy, and Smart Patch:
state commands, line/rect/ellipse/arc/path/polygon/image primitives. Text, fonts,
pixmaps, gradients, textures, rasterization, and a Qt backend are intentionally absent.

## Measured API surface

| Family | Overloads |
|---|---|
| State stack | `save()`, `restore()` |
| Pen | `pen()`, `setPen(const PkPen &)`, `setPen(const PkColor &, qreal)`, `setPen(Qt::PenStyle)` |
| Brush | `brush()`, `setBrush(const PkBrush &)`, `setBrush(const PkColor &)`, `setBrush(Qt::BrushStyle)` |
| Transform | `transform()`, `setTransform(const PkTransform &, bool)` |
| Render hints | `setRenderHint(unsigned, bool)`, `setRenderHints(unsigned, bool)` |
| Clip | `setClipRect(const PkRectF &, Qt::ClipOperation)` |
| Line | `drawLine(const PkLineF &)`, `drawLine(const PkPointF &, const PkPointF &)` |
| Rectangle | `drawRect(const PkRectF &)` |
| Ellipse | `drawEllipse(const PkRectF &)`, `drawEllipse(const PkPointF &, qreal, qreal)` |
| Arc | `drawArc(const PkRectF &, int, int)` |
| Path/polygon | `drawPath(const PkPainterPath &)`, `drawPolygon(const PkPolygonF &)` |
| Image | `drawImage(const PkRectF &, const PkImage &)` |

`setPen(Qt::PenStyle)` and `setBrush(Qt::BrushStyle)` construct fresh black default
values of the requested style, matching the measured QPainter overload semantics.
Combined transforms are tracked as `newTransform * currentTransform`, while the
submitted command preserves the original transform plus its `combine` flag for the
backend adapter.

No Qt backend or rasterizer lives in core. A transition adapter that consumes these
commands belongs above `pk/render` (currently the `libs/flake` boundary).

## Dependency checks

`tests/run_tests.sh` runs the brief's blanket `nm -u -C ... | grep -i qt` command and
reports its real exit code. That grep intentionally matches copied compatibility names
(`Qt::GlobalColor`, `Qt::AspectRatioMode`, and `pk_qt_assert`), so it cannot be a clean
linkage predicate without renaming measured public APIs. The runner therefore also
enforces a reviewed real-Qt class/C-ABI matcher with an explicit compatibility
allowlist, verifies the final test executable's `readelf`/`ldd` dependency closure, and
checks Ninja's complete `pkrender` command closure for Qt targets and libraries.
